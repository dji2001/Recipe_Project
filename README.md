## Purpose of Project

Our recipe Java program allows users to store and retrieve recipes, similarly to a database. Then, users will be able to search through existing recipes, create new ones, or view all recipes. In short, our project acts as a pseudo-database and provides an organized environment for those who would like a simple location to store and create their cooking recipes! For instructions on how to use, please refer to our [UserGuide](supporting-documents/userGuide.md).
